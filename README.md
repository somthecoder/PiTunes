# PiTunes

Somrishi: Integration of Spotifyd daemon with Pi and ALSA and syncing Whisper and Spotify search together  
Cygnus: Spotify API and song search based on given text, Rust binary installation assistance  
Rishi: Whisper STT sppech transcription with microphone, sound system debugging  

## Overview:
The goal for this project was to avoid having to type out a song you wanted to listen to and instead be able to speak it and have it automatically play, similar to that of a Amazon Alexa or Google Home. As long as the Pi is connected to a speaker via USB or bluetooth, we can play music.
